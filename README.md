## Constraint Propagation

First program implements simple depth first and breadth first search for a map colouring problem.

We are trying to solve a simple map colouring problem:

    V0 <----> V1
    ^          ^
    |          |
    v          v
    V2 <----> V3
    
with colours "red" and "green"

Implement depth first search.
